# About Me
For as long as I can recall, I have been utterly fascinated by mechanical systems; I was always the kid disassembling pens at the back of class. This passion for mechanical systems inevitably led me to gain a passion for automobiles and racing. Fast-forward many years and I find myself in mechanical engineering at the University of Calgary, learning the fundamental concepts that will enable me to work on such systems in the future. Further, I joined [UCalgary Racing](https://bre-group.ca/)â€™s drivetrain subteam in 2023 which gave me the opportunity to increase my automotive engineering knowledge. Throughout my education and my brief time in the oil and gas industry, I have noticed a lack of individuals experienced in both machine learning and mechanical fields. This led me to pursue a minor in digital engineering, which will enable me to create innovative, novel solutions when paired with my mechanical engineering skillset.

I am of Egyptian and English descent and speak both English and Arabic. Although the bulk of my time is spent on engineering or engineering-adjacent activities, I am passionate about sports such as soccer, mixed martial arts, and boxing. While combat sports have taught me the value of discipline, lifetime participation in organized soccer has taught me the importance of teamwork and collaboration. I am also a tech enthusiast, with an interest in free and open-source software (FOSS). In fact, I used Linux as my primary operating system throughout my first year of engineering - until SolidWorks forced me to switch back to Windows.

Every summer, I set up a large edible garden on my balcony. The 2024 season was exceptionally successful, with large yields of potatoes, tomatoes, strawberries, radishes, lettuce, raspberries, onions, and ground cherries. Although my passion for gardening may seem comically disconnected from my other passions and hobbies, I am looking to implement an irrigation and monitoring system next summer which will meld my passions. I also love cooking, and growing my own food allows me to utilize the freshest ingredients possible.
