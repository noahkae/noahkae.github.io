  summary: >
    Born in Calgary, I have always been fascinated by mechanical systems.
    I am in my third year of pursuing a BSc in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Digital Engineering.
    As an active drivetrain member of UCalgary Racing, I am able to gain hands-on mechanical, automotive, 
    and manufacturing engineering experience.
    My work has primarily related to data exploration and machine learning,
    and I look forward to applying machine learning to mechanical engineering applications.
    When I'm not thinking about engineering,
    I'm probably thinking about cars or sports instead.

    summary: "Simulation models are often constructed when evaluating Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects. Both plume migration and injectivity are sensitive to permeability heterogeneity and faults/fractures. Initially, these models depend upon geologic concepts and a limited number of wells and are therefore lacking the required data complexity needed to populate a simulation model. "
