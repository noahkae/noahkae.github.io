<!--excerpt-->

This post serves to document the basics of pumps specifically for use in FSAE electric vehicles. Much of the information and the graphics used are from [this great resource by IEM.](https://iem.ca/pdf/resources/Fundamentals%20of%20Pumps.pdf) The information in this post is subject to change as development of the [UCalgary Racing](https://ucalgaryracing.ca/) UCR-02 commences, and as seen relevant.
