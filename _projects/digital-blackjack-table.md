For my final design project at Western Canada High School, I created an innovative blackjack table which replaced traditional cards with recycled computer monitors. Further, the project used recycled scrap wood to build the frame. This project ran using the HDMI outputs of a laptop, and a custom-built blackjack game. Despite the large quantity of materials used to create the table, my utilization of recycled wood, table felt, and monitors kept the overall project cost below $50. The table was full sized, and fully functional.

The table was named the best project in our class, getting me a perfect grade. Further, the project saw use outside of the classroom as it was then used by students in the main lunchroom to play table games.
