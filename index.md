# Hey there,

I'm Noah, a third-year mechanical engineering student at The University of Calgary. I am extremely passionate about
mechanical syetems, having been fascinated by cars and racing from a young age. In an attempt to bring a modern approach
to traditional mechanical fields, I am currently pursuing a minor in digital engineering as modern tools like machine
learning and python will prove incredibly useful in analysis and design of innovative systems.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my website!
