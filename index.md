# Hey there,

I'm Noah, a third-year mechanical engineering student at the University of Calgary. I am extremely passionate about
mechanical systems, having been fascinated by cars and racing from a young age. In an attempt to bring a modern approach
to traditional mechanical fields, I am currently pursuing a minor in digital engineering as modern tools like machine
learning and Python will prove incredibly useful in the analysis and design of innovative systems. I am passionate about cars, 
sports, technology, and many other things.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my website!
